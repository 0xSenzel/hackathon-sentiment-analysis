To get started, developers should:

1. Clone the repository
2. Create and activate a virtual environment
3. Install dependencies from requirements.txt
4. Create a `.env` file with necessary credentials
5. Start implementing the placeholder functions in each module
6. Run tests as they develop

Each placeholder file contains the basic structure and class definitions, making it easy for developers to understand what needs to be implemented while maintaining the overall architecture of the project.
